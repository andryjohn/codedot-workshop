I"Î)<p>The CSS <code class="highlighter-rouge">position</code> property is versatile and powerful. It allows to <em>set</em> or <em>alter</em> an element‚Äôs position. It has 4 possible <strong>values</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">static</code> (default value)</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">relative</code></li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">absolute</code></li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">fixed</code></li>
</ul>

<p>It‚Äôs often used alongside the 4 <strong>coordinates</strong> properties:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">left</code></li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">right</code></li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">top</code></li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">bottom</code></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="static">static</h3>

<p>This is the <strong>default</strong> <code class="highlighter-rouge">position</code> value: static elements just follow the <a href="css-the-flow.html">natural flow</a>. They aren‚Äôt affected by any <code class="highlighter-rouge">left</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">right</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">top</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">bottom</code> value.</p>

<h3 id="relative">relative</h3>

<p>When the <code class="highlighter-rouge">position</code> is set to <strong>relative</strong>, an element can move according to its <strong>current position</strong>.</p>

<p>The red paragraph has moved 20px <strong>from the left</strong> and 10px <strong>from the top</strong>, relative to its <em>natural</em> position, where it‚Äôs <em>supposed</em> to be.</p>

<p>Notice how the blue paragraphs haven‚Äôt moved at all. By using relative positioning, the red paragraph can freely move without disrupting the layout. The only thing out of place is <em>itself</em>. All the other elements <strong>don‚Äôt know that element has moved</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="absolute">absolute</h3>

<p>When the <code class="highlighter-rouge">position</code> is set to <strong>absolute</strong>, an element can move according to the <strong>first positioned ancestor</strong>.</p>

<h4 id="positioned-what-is-a-positioned-element">‚ÄúPositioned?? What is a <em>positioned</em> element?‚Äù</h4>

<p>A <strong>positioned</strong> element is one whose <code class="highlighter-rouge">position</code> value is either <code class="highlighter-rouge">relative</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">absolute</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">fixed</code>. So unless the position is not set <em>or</em> static, an element is <strong>positioned</strong>.</p>

<p>The characteristic of a <em>positioned</em> element is that it can act as a <strong>reference point for its child elements</strong>.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs imagine a simple <strong>hierarchy</strong>:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span class="nt">&lt;section&gt;</span>
  I'm in position relative.
  <span class="nt">&lt;p&gt;</span>
    I'm in position absolute!
  <span class="nt">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/section&gt;</span></code></pre></figure>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-css" data-lang="css"><span class="nt">section</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nl">background</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="no">gold</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="nl">height</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="m">200px</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="nl">padding</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="m">10px</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="nl">position</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">relative</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c">/* This turns the &lt;section&gt; into a point of reference for the &lt;p&gt; */</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="nt">p</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nl">background</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="no">limegreen</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="nl">color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="no">white</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="nl">padding</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="m">10px</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="nl">position</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">absolute</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c">/* This makes the &lt;p&gt; freely movable */</span>
  <span class="nl">bottom</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="m">10px</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c">/* 10px from the bottom */</span>
  <span class="nl">left</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="m">20px</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c">/* 20px from the left */</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<div class="result">
  <section style="background: gold; height: 200px; margin: 1em 0; padding: 10px; position: relative;">
    I'm in position relative.
    <p style="background: limegreen; bottom: 10px; color: white; left: 20px; margin: 0; padding: 10px; position: absolute;">
      I'm in position absolute!
    </p>
  </section>
</div>

<p>The yellow section has a height of <code class="highlighter-rouge">200px</code> and its position set to <code class="highlighter-rouge">relative</code>, which turns it into a <strong>point of reference for all my child elements</strong>.</p>

<p>As the green paragraph‚Äôs position is set to <code class="highlighter-rouge">absolute</code>, it can freely move <em>according to</em> the yellow section. By setting both <code class="highlighter-rouge">bottom</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">left</code> values, it will move <em>from</em> the bottom left corner.</p>

<h4 id="what-happens-if-we-set-both-left-and-right">What happens if we set both left AND right?</h4>

<p>If the <code class="highlighter-rouge">width</code> is not set, applying <code class="highlighter-rouge">left: 0</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">right: 0</code> will <strong>stretch the element across the whole width</strong>. It‚Äôs the equivalent of setting <code class="highlighter-rouge">left: 0</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">width: 100%</code>.</p>

<p>If the <code class="highlighter-rouge">width</code> is set, then the <code class="highlighter-rouge">right</code> value is discarded.</p>

<h3 id="fixed">fixed</h3>

<p>When the <code class="highlighter-rouge">position</code> is set to <strong>fixed</strong>, it acts like <strong>absolute</strong>: you can set left/right and top/bottom coordinates.</p>

<p>The only difference is that the <strong>point of reference is the viewport</strong>. It means that a fixed element <em>won‚Äôt scroll</em> with the page ; it is <em>fixed</em> on the screen.</p>
